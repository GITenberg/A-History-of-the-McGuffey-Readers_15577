description: '[The McGuffey readers] "represent the first efforts in an educational
  and business enterprise that has for three quarters of a century called for the
  best exertions of many skilled men, and in their several forms these books have
  taken a conspicuous part in the education of millions of the citizens of this country.
  But what interest can the history of the McGuffey Eclectic Readers have to those
  who did not use these books in their school career? Their story differs from that
  of other readers since in successive forms, adjusted more or less perfectly to the
  changing demands of the schools, they attained a wider and more prolonged use than
  has been accorded to any other series" --p. 2.'
